## Notes:

I agreed to submit this for Thursday 13th December, so have done so. I started to rewrite the program in pure functions, but if I had more time I would like to rewrite it to be more akin to a redux-style reducer.

I feel the actual data object itself is somewhat messy currently, and would like to have formatted it differently, with co-ordinates as their own objects with respective x, y properties rather than arrays or strings.

I will likely create a new branch on this repo which will factor in these plans, but master will remain as delivered on Thursday 13th December.
